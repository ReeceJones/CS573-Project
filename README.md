## Literature Review

  - Good background on recommendation systems. This will help us guide our search in what we are looking for out of a recommendation system. Luckily, our dataset contains review information so I think it should be easy to use this for recipe recommendation. I think the techniques discussed could also be used as part of a model, or we could incorporate our learned models on it.

  - Uses one of the methods of the above article, but goes more in depth on specific feature engineering aspects, and model selection. I think this will also be useful for some of our text-processing tasks.

- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366424.3383536 this seems to do something very similar to our plan and could be a great resource for the text generation part. Better link here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02498
